      "\n",
      "*   **Component Purpose:** This component is a PrimeFaces command button. It's designed to trigger an action on the server when clicked.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Attributes:**\n",
      "    *   `value=\"Save User\"`: This sets the text displayed on the button.\n",
      "    *   `action=\"#{userBean.save}\"`: This specifies the server-side method to be invoked when the button is clicked. In this case, it's the `save()` method of the `userBean` managed bean.\n",
      "    *   `update=\"userTable\"`: This attribute indicates that after the `action` is executed, the component with the ID \"userTable\" on the client-side will be updated. This is part of the AJAX behavior.\n",
      "    *   `icon=\"pi pi-save\"`: This attribute applies an icon from the PrimeIcons library (specifically, a save icon) to the button.\n",
      "    *   `styleClass=\"btn-blue\"`: This applies a custom CSS class named \"btn-blue\" to the button, likely for styling purposes.\n",
      "    *   `rendered=\"#{userBean.editMode}\"`: This is a conditional rendering attribute. The button will only be displayed on the page if the `editMode` property of the `userBean` evaluates to `true`.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AJAX Behavior:** Yes, this button has AJAX behavior enabled by default because the `update` attribute is present. When clicked:\n",
      "    *   The browser will send an AJAX request to the server.\n",
      "    *   The `userBean.save()` method will be executed on the server.\n",
      "    *   After the server-side action completes, the component with the ID \"userTable\" will be re-rendered on the client without a full page reload.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Server-Side Bean Method:** The server-side method that will be executed is `save()` from the `userBean`. This method is expected to contain the logic for saving user data.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **UI Parts to Update:** The UI component with the ID \"userTable\" will be updated. This suggests that \"userTable\" is likely a PrimeFaces `p:dataTable` or a similar component that displays user information, and its content will be refreshed to reflect any changes made by the `save` action.\n",
      "Angular_Migration_Architect > Okay, let's migrate this `p:commandButton` to an Angular component.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 1. Angular Component Structure\n",
      "\n",
      "We will create a new Angular component, let's call it `SaveButtonComponent`. This component will encapsulate the button's logic, template, and styling.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`save-button.component.ts`**: Contains the TypeScript logic for the component, including event handlers and interaction with services.\n",
      "*   **`save-button.component.html`**: Defines the HTML structure of the button.\n",
      "*   **`save-button.component.css`**: Holds the component-specific styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Component Files Breakdown\n",
      "\n",
      "#### `save-button.component.html` (Template)\n",
      "\n",
      "```html\n",
      "<button\n",
      "  mat-raised-button\n",
      "  color=\"primary\"\n",
      "  (click)=\"onSaveClick()\"\n",
      "  [disabled]=\"isSaving\"\n",
      "  *ngIf=\"isEditMode\"\n",
      ">\n",
      "  <mat-icon class=\"button-icon\">save</mat-icon>\n",
      "  Save User\n",
      "</button>\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`<button>`:** The native HTML button element is used.\n",
      "*   **`mat-raised-button color=\"primary\"`:** This leverages Angular Material for styling. `mat-raised-button` provides a raised, distinct button appearance, and `color=\"primary\"` applies the theme's primary color. You could also use other Material button types like `mat-flat-button` or `mat-stroked-button`.\n",
      "*   **`(click)=\"onSaveClick()\"`:** This is the Angular event binding for the click event. When the button is clicked, the `onSaveClick()` method in the component's TypeScript file will be executed. This replaces the `action=\"#{userBean.save}\"`.\n",
      "*   **`[disabled]=\"isSaving\"`:** This is a property binding that disables the button when the `isSaving` property is true. This is a common pattern to prevent multiple submissions while an operation is in progress.\n",
      "*   **`*ngIf=\"isEditMode\"`:** This is a structural directive that conditionally renders the button. It will only be present in the DOM if the `isEditMode` property in the component's TypeScript is `true`. This directly maps to `rendered=\"#{userBean.editMode}\"`.\n",
      "*   **`<mat-icon class=\"button-icon\">save</mat-icon>`:** This uses Angular Material's icon component. The `save` value corresponds to an icon name available in the Material Icons font (or whatever icon library you've configured with Angular Material). This replaces `icon=\"pi pi-save\"`.\n",
      "*   **`Save User`:** This is the text displayed on the button, corresponding to `value=\"Save User\"`.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### `save-button.component.ts` (Logic)\n",
      "\n",
      "```typescript\n",

      "        console.log('User saved successfully!');\n",
      "        this.saveSuccess.emit(); // Notify parent component\n",

      "        console.error('Error saving user:', error);\n",
      "        this.saveError.emit('Failed to save user. Please try again.'); // Notify parent component\n",
      "      },\n",
      "      // Use finalize to ensure isSaving is reset regardless of success or error\n",

      "      }\n",
      "    });\n",
      "  }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`@Input() isEditMode: boolean = false;`:** This input property receives the edit mode state from the parent component. It controls the `*ngIf` directive in the template. This is how the `rendered` attribute is translated.\n",
      "*   **`@Output() saveSuccess = new EventEmitter<void>();` and `@Output() saveError = new EventEmitter<string>();`:** These output properties allow the `SaveButtonComponent` to communicate back to its parent component. When the save operation is successful or fails, these events are emitted. This is how the parent component can react to the save outcome (e.g., refresh the user table).\n",
      "*   **`isSaving: boolean = false;`:** This internal state variable controls the button's disabled attribute (`[disabled]`).\n",
      "*   **`constructor(private userService: UserService)`:** We inject a `UserService` (or a similar service responsible for backend communication). This service will contain the method to perform the actual save operation.\n",
      "*   **`onSaveClick(): void`:** This method is triggered by the button's click event.\n",
      "    *   It sets `isSaving` to `true` to disable the button.\n",
      "    *   **`this.userService.saveUser().subscribe(...)`:** This is the core of the AJAX replacement. It calls a method on the `userService` which is expected to return an `Observable`. The `subscribe` method handles the asynchronous response:\n",
      "        *   **`next`:** Executed on successful completion of the `saveUser` operation. It logs a message and emits the `saveSuccess` event.\n",
      "        *   **`error`:** Executed if the `saveUser` operation fails. It logs the error and emits the `saveError` event.\n",
      "        *   **`complete`:** This is crucial. It's executed whether the observable completed successfully or with an error. We reset `isSaving` here to re-enable the button. This pattern effectively replaces the AJAX update mechanism. The parent component, listening to `saveSuccess` or `saveError`, can then trigger a refresh of its own data (which would include the \"userTable\").\n",
      "\n",
      "#### `save-button.component.css` (Styling Ideas)\n",
      "\n",
      "```css\n",
      ".button-icon {\n",
      "  margin-right: 8px; /* Add some space between the icon and the text */\n",
      "  font-size: 18px;   /* Adjust icon size if needed */\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "/* You can add more specific styles here if needed, or rely on Angular Material */\n",

      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`.button-icon`:** Basic styling to add spacing and potentially adjust the icon size.\n",
      "*   **`button.mat-raised-button.btn-blue`:** This shows how you *could* apply a custom class like `btn-blue` if you wanted to override Angular Material's default theming or maintain a specific brand color. However, often, relying on Angular Material's color system (`color=\"primary\"`, `color=\"accent\"`, etc.) is sufficient and more maintainable. If `btn-blue` has very specific padding, margins, or layout that Material doesn't cover, you'd add it here.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. How AJAX Behavior Maps to Angular\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`update=\"userTable\"` → Angular State Update & Parent Component Logic:**\n",
      "    *   In JSF, `update` tells PrimeFaces which components to re-render after the action.\n",
      "    *   In Angular, this is handled by **component communication** and **state management**.\n",
      "    *   The `SaveButtonComponent` emits `saveSuccess` or `saveError` events.\n",
      "    *   The **parent component** that uses `app-save-button` listens to these events (`(saveSuccess)=\"onSaveCompleted()\"`, `(saveError)=\"onSaveFailed($event)\"`).\n",
      "    *   Inside the parent component's handler methods (`onSaveCompleted`, `onSaveFailed`), it would then trigger a refresh of its own data, which would include fetching the latest data for the \"userTable\" (e.g., by calling another method on `UserService` to get the updated list of users). This new data would then be bound to the table in the parent's template, causing it to re-render.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`action=\"#{userBean.save}\"` → Angular Service Call:**\n",
      "    *   The JSF `action` attribute points to a server-side method.\n",
      "    *   In Angular, this is achieved by calling a method on a **service** (e.g., `UserService`). This service encapsulates the logic for interacting with your backend API (using `HttpClient`).\n",
      "    *   The `onSaveClick()` method in `SaveButtonComponent` calls `this.userService.saveUser()`.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`rendered=\"#{userBean.editMode}\"` → `*ngIf` Directive:**\n",
      "    *   The `rendered` attribute controls the presence of the component in the DOM based on a condition.\n",
      "    *   In Angular, the `*ngIf` structural directive does exactly this. The `isEditMode` input property of `SaveButtonComponent` is bound to the `*ngIf` condition. The parent component controls the value of `isEditMode`.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`disabled` (Implicit from `rendered` and potential UI needs) → `[disabled]` Property Binding:**\n",
      "    *   While not explicitly in the provided JSF, buttons are often disabled during operations or based on conditions.\n",
      "    *   The `[disabled]=\"isSaving\"` binding in the Angular template controls the native HTML button's disabled state. The `isSaving` property in the component's TypeScript is managed internally.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`icon=\"pi pi-save\"` → Angular Material Icons / Custom Icon Solution:**\n",
      "    *   PrimeFaces uses PrimeIcons.\n",
      "    *   Angular Material provides the `mat-icon` component, which can use various iconsets (Material Icons, Font Awesome, etc.). We've used `mat-icon` with the name `save` assuming Material Icons are configured. If you use a different icon library, you would adapt this accordingly (e.g., using a `<i>` tag with specific classes).\n",

       " \n",
       " This plan outlines the conversion of a PrimeFaces `p:commandButton` to its equivalent Angular architecture.\n",
       " \n",
       " ### 1. Angular Component Structure\n",
       " \n",
       " We will create a new Angular component, let's call it `SaveButtonComponent`. This component will encapsulate the button's logic, template, and styling.\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`save-button.component.ts`**: Contains the TypeScript logic for the component, including event handlers and interaction with services.\n",
       " *   **`save-button.component.html`**: Defines the HTML structure of the button.\n",
       " *   **`save-button.component.css`**: Holds the component-specific styles.\n",
       " \n",
       " ### 2. Component Files Breakdown\n",
       " \n",
       " #### `save-button.component.html` (Template)\n",
       " \n",
       " ```html\n",
       " <button\n",
       "   mat-raised-button\n",
       "   color=\"primary\"\n",
       "   (click)=\"onSaveClick()\"\n",
       "   [disabled]=\"isSaving\"\n",
       "   *ngIf=\"isEditMode\"\n",
       " >\n",
       "   <mat-icon class=\"button-icon\">save</mat-icon>\n",
       "   Save User\n",
       " </button>\n",
       " ```\n",
       " \n",
       " **Explanation:**\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`<button>`:** The native HTML button element is used.\n",
       " *   **`mat-raised-button color=\"primary\"`:** This leverages Angular Material for styling. `mat-raised-button` provides a raised, distinct button appearance, and `color=\"primary\"` applies the theme's primary color. You could also use other Material button types like `mat-flat-button` or `mat-stroked-button`.\n",
       " *   **`(click)=\"onSaveClick()\"`:** This is the Angular event binding for the click event. When the button is clicked, the `onSaveClick()` method in the component's TypeScript file will be executed. This replaces the `action=\"#{userBean.save}\"`.\n",
       " *   **`[disabled]=\"isSaving\"`:** This is a property binding that disables the button when the `isSaving` property is true. This is a common pattern to prevent multiple submissions while an operation is in progress.\n",
       " *   **`*ngIf=\"isEditMode\"`:** This is a structural directive that conditionally renders the button. It will only be present in the DOM if the `isEditMode` property in the component's TypeScript is `true`. This directly maps to `rendered=\"#{userBean.editMode}\"`.\n",
       " *   **`<mat-icon class=\"button-icon\">save</mat-icon>`:** This uses Angular Material's icon component. The `save` value corresponds to an icon name available in the Material Icons font (or whatever icon library you've configured with Angular Material). This replaces `icon=\"pi pi-save\"`.\n",
       " *   **`Save User`:** This is the text displayed on the button, corresponding to `value=\"Save User\"`.\n",

       "     });\n",
       "   }\n",
       " }\n",
       " ```\n",
       " \n",
       " **Explanation:**\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`@Input() isEditMode: boolean = false;`:** This input property receives the edit mode state from the parent component. It controls the `*ngIf` directive in the template. This is how the `rendered` attribute is translated.\n",
       " *   **`@Output() saveSuccess = new EventEmitter<void>();` and `@Output() saveError = new EventEmitter<string>();`:** These output properties allow the `SaveButtonComponent` to communicate back to its parent component. When the save operation is successful or fails, these events are emitted. This is how the parent component can react to the save outcome (e.g., refresh the user table).\n",
       " *   **`isSaving: boolean = false;`:** This internal state variable controls the button's disabled attribute (`[disabled]`).\n",
       " *   **`constructor(private userService: UserService)`:** We inject a `UserService` (or a similar service responsible for backend communication). This service will contain the method to perform the actual save operation.\n",
       " *   **`onSaveClick(): void`:** This method is triggered by the button's click event.\n",
       "     *   It sets `isSaving` to `true` to disable the button.\n",
       "     *   **`this.userService.saveUser().subscribe(...)`:** This is the core of the AJAX replacement. It calls a method on the `userService` which is expected to return an `Observable`. The `subscribe` method handles the asynchronous response:\n",
       "         *   **`next`:** Executed on successful completion of the `saveUser` operation. It logs a message and emits the `saveSuccess` event.\n",
       "         *   **`error`:** Executed if the `saveUser` operation fails. It logs the error and emits the `saveError` event.\n",
       "         *   **`complete`:** This is crucial. It's executed whether the observable completed successfully or with an error. We reset `isSaving` here to re-enable the button. This pattern effectively replaces the AJAX update mechanism. The parent component, listening to `saveSuccess` or `saveError`, can then trigger a refresh of its own data (which would include the \"userTable\").\n",
       " \n",
       " #### `save-button.component.css` (Styling Ideas)\n",
       " \n",
       " ```css\n",
       " .button-icon {\n",
       "   margin-right: 8px; /* Add some space between the icon and the text */\n",
       "   font-size: 18px;   /* Adjust icon size if needed */\n",
       " }\n",
       " \n",
       " /* You can add more specific styles here if needed, or rely on Angular Material */\n",
       " /* Example for the btn-blue class, if you want to maintain a similar look */\n",
       " /* If using Angular Material's primary color, this might be redundant */\n",
       " button.mat-raised-button.btn-blue {\n",
       "   background-color: #007bff; /* Example blue color */\n",
       "   color: white;\n",
       " }\n",
       " \n",
       " button.mat-raised-button.btn-blue:hover {\n",
       "   background-color: #0056b3; /* Darker blue on hover */\n",
       " }\n",
       " ```\n",
       " \n",
       " **Explanation:**\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`.button-icon`:** Basic styling to add spacing and potentially adjust the icon size.\n",
       " *   **`button.mat-raised-button.btn-blue`:** This shows how you *could* apply a custom class like `btn-blue` if you wanted to override Angular Material's default theming or maintain a specific brand color. However, often, relying on Angular Material's color system (`color=\"primary\"`, `color=\"accent\"`, etc.) is sufficient and more maintainable. If `btn-blue` has very specific padding, margins, or layout that Material doesn't cover, you'd add it here.\n",
       " \n",
       " ### 3. How AJAX Behavior Maps to Angular\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`update=\"userTable\"` → Angular State Update & Parent Component Logic:**\n",
       "     *   In JSF, `update` tells PrimeFaces which components to re-render after the action.\n",
       "     *   In Angular, this is handled by **component communication** and **state management**.\n",
       "     *   The `SaveButtonComponent` emits `saveSuccess` or `saveError` events.\n",
       "     *   The **parent component** that uses `app-save-button` listens to these events (`(saveSuccess)=\"onSaveCompleted()\"`, `(saveError)=\"onSaveFailed($event)\"`).\n",
       "     *   Inside the parent component's handler methods (`onSaveCompleted`, `onSaveFailed`), it would then trigger a refresh of its own data, which would include fetching the latest data for the \"userTable\" (e.g., by calling another method on `UserService` to get the updated list of users). This new data would then be bound to the table in the parent's template, causing it to re-render.\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`action=\"#{userBean.save}\"` → Angular Service Call:**\n",
       "     *   The JSF `action` attribute points to a server-side method.\n",
       "     *   In Angular, this is achieved by calling a method on a **service** (e.g., `UserService`). This service encapsulates the logic for interacting with your backend API (using `HttpClient`).\n",
       "     *   The `onSaveClick()` method in `SaveButtonComponent` calls `this.userService.saveUser()`.\n",
       " \n",

Angular Component Structure\\n\\nWe will create a new Angular component, let\\'s call it `SaveButtonComponent`. This component will encapsulate the button\\'s logic, template, and styling.\\n\\n*   **`save-button.component.ts`**: Contains the TypeScript logic for the component, including event handlers and interaction with services.\\n*   **`save-button.component.html`**: Defines the HTML structure of the button.\\n*   **`save-button.component.css`**: Holds the component-specific styles.\\n\\n### 2. Component Files Breakdown\\n\\n#### `save-button.component.html` (Template)\\n\\n```html\\n<button\\n  mat-raised-button\\n  color=\"primary\"\\n  (click)=\"onSaveClick()\"\\n  [disabled]=\"isSaving\"\\n  *ngIf=\"isEditMode\"\\n>\\n  <mat-icon class=\"button-icon\">save</mat-icon>\\n  Save User\\n</button>\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n*   **`<button>`:** The native HTML button element is used.\\n*   **`mat-raised-button color=\"primary\"`:** This leverages Angular Material for styling. `mat-raised-button` provides a raised, distinct button appearance, and `color=\"primary\"` applies the theme\\'s primary color. You could also use other Material button types like `mat-flat-button` or `mat-stroked-button`.\\n*   **`(click)=\"onSaveClick()\"`:** This is the Angular event binding for the click event. When the button is clicked, the `onSaveClick()` method in the component\\'s TypeScript file will be executed. This replaces the `action=\"#{userBean.save}\"`.\\n*   **`[disabled]=\"isSaving\"`:** This is a property binding that disables the button when the `isSaving` property is true. This is a common pattern to prevent multiple submissions while an operation is in progress.\\n*   **`*ngIf=\"isEditMode\"`:** This is a structural directive that conditionally renders the button. It will only be present in the DOM if the `isEditMode` property in the component\\'s TypeScript is `true`. This directly maps to `rendered=\"#{userBean.editMode}\"`.\\n*   **`<mat-icon class=\"button-icon\">save</mat-icon>`:** This uses Angular Material\\'s icon component. The `save` value corresponds to an icon name available in the Material Icons font (or whatever icon library you\\'ve configured with Angular Material). This replaces `icon=\"pi pi-save\"`.\\n*   **`Save User`:** This is the text displayed on the button, corresponding to `value=\"Save User\"`.\\n\\n#### `save-button.component.ts` (Logic)\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { Component, EventEmitter, Input, Output } from \\'@angular/core\\';\\nimport { UserService } from \\'../services/user.service\\'; // Assuming a UserService\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: \\'app-save-button\\',\\n  templateUrl: \\'./save-button.component.html\\',\\n  styleUrls: [\\'./save-button.component.css\\'],\\n})\\nexport class SaveButtonComponent {\\n  @Input() isEditMode: boolean = false; // Corresponds to rendered=\"#{userBean.editMode}\"\\n  @Output() saveSuccess = new EventEmitter<void>(); // To notify parent about successful save\\n  @Output() saveError = new EventEmitter<string>(); // To notify parent about save errors\\n\\n  isSaving: boolean = false; // To manage button disabled state\\n\\n  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}\\n\\n  onSaveClick(): void {\\n    this.isSaving = true; // Disable button during save operation\\n\\n    // This replaces the server-side action=\"#{userBean.save}\"\\n    this.userService.saveUser().subscribe({\\n      next: () => {\\n        console.log(\\'User saved successfully!\\');\\n        this.saveSuccess.emit(); // Notify parent component\\n      },\\n      error: (error) => {\\n        console.error(\\'Error saving user:\\', error);\\n        this.saveError.emit(\\'Failed to save user. Please try again.\\'); // Notify parent component\\n      },\\n      // Use finalize to ensure isSaving is reset regardless of success or error\\n      // This is a more robust way than putting it in both next and error callbacks\\n      complete: () => {\\n        this.isSaving = false;\\n      }\\n    });\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n*   **`@Input() isEditMode: boolean = false;`:** This input property receives the edit mode state from the parent component. It controls the `*ngIf` directive in the template. This is how the `rendered` attribute is translated.\\n*   **`@Output() saveSuccess = new EventEmitter<void>();` and `@Output() saveError = new EventEmitter<string>();`:** These output properties allow the `SaveButtonComponent` to communicate back to its parent component. When the save operation is successful or fails, these events are emitted. This is how the parent component can react to the save outcome (e.g., refresh the user table).\\n*   **`isSaving: boolean = false;`:** This internal state variable controls the button\\'s disabled attribute (`[disabled]`).\\n*   **`constructor(private userService: UserService)`:** We inject a `UserService` (or a similar service responsible for backend communication). This service will contain the method to perform the actual save operation.\\n*   **`onSaveClick(): void`:** This method is triggered by the button\\'s click event.\\n    *   It sets `isSaving` to `true` to disable the button.\\n    *   **`this.userService.saveUser().subscribe(...)`:** This is the core of the AJAX replacement. It calls a method on the `userService` which is expected to return an `Observable`. The `subscribe` method handles the asynchronous response:\\n        *   **`next`:** Executed on successful completion of the `saveUser` operation. It logs a message and emits the `saveSuccess` event.\\n        *   **`error`:** Executed if the `saveUser` operation fails. It logs the error and emits the `saveError` event.\\n        *   **`complete`:** This is crucial. It\\'s executed whether the observable completed successfully or with an error. We reset `isSaving` here to re-enable the button. This pattern effectively replaces the AJAX update mechanism. The parent component, listening to `saveSuccess` or `saveError`, can then trigger a refresh of its own data (which would include the \"userTable\").\\n\\n#### `save-button.component.css` (Styling Ideas)\\n\\n```css\\n.button-icon {\\n  margin-right: 8px; /* Add some space between the icon and the text */\\n  font-size: 18px;   /* Adjust icon size if needed */\\n}\\n\\n/* You can add more specific styles here if needed, or rely on Angular Material */\\n/* Example for the btn-blue class, if you want to maintain a similar look */\\n/* If using Angular Material\\'s primary color, this might be redundant */\\nbutton.mat-raised-button.btn-blue {\\n  background-color: #007bff; /* Example blue color */\\n  color: white;\\n}\\n\\nbutton.mat-raised-button.btn-blue:hover {\\n  background-color: #0056b3; /* Darker blue on hover */\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n*   **`.button-icon`:** Basic styling to add spacing and potentially adjust the icon size.\\n*   **`button.mat-raised-button.btn-blue`:** This shows how you *could* apply a custom class like `btn-blue` if you wanted to override Angular Material\\'s default theming or maintain a specific brand color. However, often, relying on Angular Material\\'s color system (`color=\"primary\"`, `color=\"accent\"`, etc.) is sufficient and more maintainable. If `btn-blue` has very specific padding, margins, or layout that Material doesn\\'t cover, you\\'d add it here.\\n\\n### 3. How AJAX Behavior Maps to Angular\\n\\n*   **`update=\"userTable\"` → Angular State Update & Parent Component Logic:**\\n    *   In JSF, `update` tells PrimeFaces which components to re-render after the action.\\n    *   In Angular, this is handled by **component communication** and **state management**.\\n    *   The `SaveButtonComponent` emits `saveSuccess` or `saveError` events.\\n    *   The **parent component** that uses `app-save-button` listens to these events (`(saveSuccess)=\"onSaveCompleted()\"`, `(saveError)=\"onSaveFailed($event)\"`).\\n    *   Inside the parent component\\'s handler methods (`onSaveCompleted`, `onSaveFailed`), it would then trigger a refresh of its own data, which would include fetching the latest data for the \"userTable\" (e.g., by calling another method on `UserService` to get the updated list of users). This new data would then be bound to the table in the parent\\'s template, causing it to re-render.\\n\\n*   **`action=\"#{userBean.save}\"` → Angular Service Call:**\\n    *   The JSF `action` attribute points to a server-side method.\\n    *   In Angular, this is achieved by calling a method on a **service** (e.g., `UserService`). This service encapsulates the logic for interacting with your backend API (using `HttpClient`).\\n    *   The `onSaveClick()` method in `SaveButtonComponent` calls `this.userService.saveUser()`.\\n\\n*   **`rendered=\"#{userBean.editMode}\"` → `*ngIf` Directive:**\\n    *   The `rendered` attribute controls the presence of the component in the DOM based on a condition.\\n    *   In Angular, the `*ngIf` structural directive does exactly this. The `isEditMode` input property of `SaveButtonComponent` is bound to the `*ngIf` condition. The parent component controls the value of `isEditMode`.\\n\\n*   **`disabled` (Implicit from `rendered` and potential UI needs) → `[disabled]` Property Binding:**\\n    *   While not explicitly in the provided JSF, buttons are often disabled during operations or based on conditions.\\n    *   The `[disabled]=\"isSaving\"` binding in the Angular template controls the native HTML button\\'s disabled state. The `isSaving` property in the component\\'s TypeScript is managed internally.\\n\\n*   **`icon=\"pi pi-save\"` → Angular Material Icons / Custom Icon Solution:**\\n    *   PrimeFaces uses PrimeIcons.\\n    *   Angular Material provides the `mat-icon` component, which can use various iconsets (Material Icons, Font Awesome, etc.). We\\'ve used `mat-icon` with the name `save` assuming Material Icons are configured. If you use a different icon library, you would adapt this accordingly (e.g., using a `<i>` tag with specific classes).\\n\\n*   **`styleClass=\"btn-blue\"` → Component CSS / Theming:**\\n    *   JSF `styleClass` applies a CSS class.\\n    *   In Angular, this can be achieved by:\\n        *   Adding the class directly in the component\\'s HTML template (e.g., `<button class=\"btn-blue\">`).\\n        *   Using Angular Material\\'s theming system (e.g., `color=\"primary\"`).\\n        *   Adding styles to the component\\'s `.css` file.\\n\\n### 4.

      "*   **`<mat-form-field>`:** This is the Angular Material wrapper for form field components. It provides consistent styling, labels, hints, and error messages.\n",
      "    *   `[appearance]=\"appearance\"`: Allows configuring the form field's appearance (e.g., 'fill', 'outline'). This is an `@Input()` property.\n",
      "    *   `class=\"input-big\"`: Applies the custom CSS class for styling, directly mapping `styleClass=\"input-big\"`.\n",
      "    *   `[floatLabel]=\"floatLabel\"`: Controls label behavior (e.g., 'auto', 'always', 'never'). This is an `@Input()` property.\n",
      "*   **`<mat-label>{{ label }}</mat-label>`:** Displays the label for the input field. The `label` is provided via an `@Input()` property.\n",
      "*   **`<input matInput ... />`:**\n",
      "    *   `matInput`: This directive is essential for making the native `<input>` element work correctly within `<mat-form-field>`.\n",
      "    *   `type=\"text\"`: Specifies the input type.\n",
      "    *   **`[ngModel]=\"value\"`:** This is two-way data binding using the `FormsModule` (or `ReactiveFormsModule`). It binds the input's value to the `value` property in the component's TypeScript. This replaces `value=\"#{userBean.name}\"` in terms of data binding.\n",
      "    *   **`(ngModelChange)=\"onValueChange($event)\"`:** This event is emitted whenever the input's value changes. We handle it in our component's `onValueChange` method.\n",
      "    *   **`[maxlength]=\"maxlength\"`:** Sets the `maxlength` attribute on the HTML input element. This is driven by an `@Input()` property `maxlength`. This maps to `maxlength=\"50\"`.\n",
      "    *   **`[required]=\"required\"`:** Sets the `required` attribute on the HTML input element. This is driven by an `@Input()` property `required`. This maps to `required=\"true\"`.\n",
      "    *   `[placeholder]=\"placeholder\"`: Sets the placeholder text. Driven by an `@Input()` property.\n",
      "    *   **`#inputElement`:** This is a template reference variable. It gives us direct access to the native input element and its properties/methods within the template, particularly useful for accessing validation state (`invalid`, `dirty`, `touched`, `errors`).\n",
      "*   **`<mat-error ...>`:** This section displays validation error messages.\n",
      "    *   `*ngIf=\"inputElement.invalid && (inputElement.dirty || inputElement.touched)\"`: The error message is only shown if the input is invalid *and* the user has interacted with it (either typed in it or blurred from it).\n",
      "    *   `*ngIf=\"inputElement.errors?.['required']\"`: Checks if the `required` validation error is present.\n",
      "    *   `{{ requiredErrorMsg }}`: Displays a customizable error message for the required field.\n",

      "*   **`providers: [...]`:** This configures the component to provide itself as an implementation of `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR`. This is how Angular's forms system discovers and interacts with our custom input component. `forwardRef` is necessary because `TextInputComponent` refers to itself within its own provider definition.\n",
      "*   **`@Input() ...`:** These properties allow the parent component to configure the `TextInputComponent` (label, placeholder, maxlength, required status, etc.). These directly map to the attributes of the original JSF component.\n",
      "*   **`value: string = '';`:** This internal property holds the current value of the input. It's bound to the `<input>` using `[ngModel]`.\n",
      "*   **`onValueChange(newValue: string): void`:** This method is called by `(ngModelChange)`. It updates the internal `value` and, importantly, calls `this.onChange(newValue)`. `onChange` is a function provided by Angular's forms module (via `ControlValueAccessor`) that signals the change upstream. It also calls `this.onTouched()` to mark the control as touched.\n",

      "*   **`.input-big`:** This CSS class directly corresponds to the `styleClass=\"input-big\"` attribute. You would put styles here to control the size, spacing, or any other visual aspects of the input field container. Using `width: 100%` within a flexible layout is common.\n",
      "*   The commented-out `::ng-deep` example shows how you *could* style deeper elements if absolutely necessary, but it's generally discouraged as it breaks encapsulation. Prefer using Angular Material's built-in configuration options or styling the host component (`.input-big`) where possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "*   **`value=\"#{userBean.name}\"` → Two-way Binding (`[ngModel]`, `(ngModelChange)`) and `ControlValueAccessor`:**\n",
      "    *   JSF's `value` attribute creates a direct link between the UI element and the managed bean property.\n",
      "    *   Angular uses `[ngModel]` for binding the data property (`value` in `TextInputComponent`) to the input element.\n",
      "    *   `(ngModelChange)` captures user input.\n",
      "    *   The `ControlValueAccessor` implementation (`writeValue`, `registerOnChange`) ensures that this component integrates seamlessly with Angular's form handling, allowing it to receive updates (like `userBean.name = 'new value'`) and emit changes back to a parent form control or service.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`required=\"true\"` → `[required]` attribute and Angular Forms Validation:**\n",
      "    *   JSF's `required=\"true\"` triggers server-side validation.\n",
      "    *   In Angular, we use the native HTML `[required]` attribute binding, which provides client-side validation.\n",
      "    *   We also leverage Angular's forms validation system by implementing `ControlValueAccessor`. The template checks `inputElement.errors?.['required']` to display a user-friendly message. This validation typically runs before any API call is made.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`maxlength=\"50\"` → `[maxlength]` attribute and Angular Forms Validation:**\n",
      "    *   JSF's `maxlength` enforces a character limit.\n",
      "    *   Similar to `required`, we bind the `maxlength` attribute to the HTML input. This provides immediate client-side feedback.\n",
      "    *   Angular's forms validation system also recognizes the `maxlength` error (accessible via `inputElement.errors?.['maxlength']`), allowing for consistent error message display.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **`styleClass=\"input-big\"` → CSS Class Binding:**\n",
      "    *   This is a direct mapping. The `styleClass` attribute in JSF becomes a class binding (`class=\"input-big\"`) or is managed within the component's CSS file.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **No Direct AJAX/Server Calls:**\n",
      "    *   Unlike components that trigger server actions, `p:inputText` primarily handles data binding and validation.\n",
      "    *   In Angular, this component focuses *only* on the UI element and its local validation. The actual submission of data (like calling a `saveUser` API) would be handled by a parent component or a dedicated form component that uses this `TextInputComponent` as part of its larger form structure. The parent component would gather all input values (potentially using `FormGroup`) and then trigger the service call.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Integration Notes\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **FormsModule/ReactiveFormsModule:** Ensure that `FormsModule` (for `ngModel`) or `ReactiveFormsModule` (for `FormGroup`, `FormControl`) is imported into your Angular module where this component is declared or used.\n",
      "*   **Angular Material:** Make sure Angular Material is set up in your project and `MatFormFieldModule`, `MatInputModule`, and `MatIconModule` (if using icons in other components) are imported into the appropriate module.\n",

       " **Explanation:**\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`implements ControlValueAccessor`:** This interface is crucial for integrating the custom component into Angular's reactive forms (`FormGroup`, `FormControl`) or template-driven forms (`ngModel`). It allows Angular's form system to read and write values to our component and track its state (dirty, touched, valid).\n",
       " *   **`providers: [...]`:** This configures the component to provide itself as an implementation of `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR`. This is how Angular's forms system discovers and interacts with our custom input component. `forwardRef` is necessary because `TextInputComponent` refers to itself within its own provider definition.\n",
       " *   **`@Input() ...`:** These properties allow the parent component to configure the `TextInputComponent` (label, placeholder, maxlength, required status, etc.). These directly map to the attributes of the original JSF component.\n",
       " *   **`value: string = '';`:** This internal property holds the current value of the input. It's bound to the `<input>` using `[ngModel]`.\n",
       " *   **`onValueChange(newValue: string): void`:** This method is called by `(ngModelChange)`. It updates the internal `value` and, importantly, calls `this.onChange(newValue)`. `onChange` is a function provided by Angular's forms module (via `ControlValueAccessor`) that signals the change upstream. It also calls `this.onTouched()` to mark the control as touched.\n",
       " *   **`ControlValueAccessor` Methods:**\n",
       "     *   `registerOnChange`: Stores the callback function that Angular uses to update the form control's value when our component's value changes.\n",
       "     *   `registerOnTouched`: Stores the callback function that Angular uses to mark the form control as touched.\n",
       "     *   `writeValue`: This method is called by Angular's forms API to set the component's value programmatically. This is how `userBean.name` being updated would reflect in the input field.\n",
       "     *   `setDisabledState` (Optional): Can be used to handle disabling the input if the parent form control is disabled.\n",
       " \n",
       " #### `text-input.component.css` (Styling Ideas)\n",
       " \n",
       " ```css\n",
       " /* Example for the 'input-big' class */\n",
       " /* This might be redundant if using Angular Material's default sizing, */\n",
       " /* but useful for specific overrides. */\n",
       " .input-big {\n",
       "   /* Example: Make the input field wider */\n",
       "   width: 100%; /* Or a specific pixel value like 300px */\n",
       "   /* Adjust margins, padding as needed */\n",
       "   margin-bottom: 16px;\n",
       " }\n",
       " \n",
       " /* If you need to style the native input element directly within the mat-form-field */\n",
       " /* Use ::ng-deep or specific selectors if necessary, but try to avoid it */\n",
       " /* For example, to increase font size: */\n",
       " /* ::ng-deep .mat-form-field-wrapper .mat-form-field-flex .mat-form-field-infix input.mat-input-element {\n",
       "   font-size: 1.2em;\n",
       " } */\n",
       " \n",
       " /* Or better, rely on Angular Material theming and input properties */\n",
       " ```\n",
       " \n",
       " **Explanation:**\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`.input-big`:** This CSS class directly corresponds to the `styleClass=\"input-big\"` attribute. You would put styles here to control the size, spacing, or any other visual aspects of the input field container. Using `width: 100%` within a flexible layout is common.\n",
       " *   The commented-out `::ng-deep` example shows how you *could* style deeper elements if absolutely necessary, but it's generally discouraged as it breaks encapsulation. Prefer using Angular Material's built-in configuration options or styling the host component (`.input-big`) where possible.\n",
       " \n",
       " ### 3. How AJAX Behavior Maps to Angular\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`value=\"#{userBean.name}\"` → Two-way Binding (`[ngModel]`, `(ngModelChange)`) and `ControlValueAccessor`:**\n",
       "     *   JSF's `value` attribute creates a direct link between the UI element and the managed bean property.\n",
       "     *   Angular uses `[ngModel]` for binding the data property (`value` in `TextInputComponent`) to the input element.\n",
       "     *   `(ngModelChange)` captures user input.\n",
       "     *   The `ControlValueAccessor` implementation (`writeValue`, `registerOnChange`) ensures that this component integrates seamlessly with Angular's form handling, allowing it to receive updates (like `userBean.name = 'new value'`) and emit changes back to a parent form control or service.\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`required=\"true\"` → `[required]` attribute and Angular Forms Validation:**\n",
       "     *   JSF's `required=\"true\"` triggers server-side validation.\n",
       "     *   In Angular, we use the native HTML `[required]` attribute binding, which provides client-side validation.\n",
       "     *   We also leverage Angular's forms validation system by implementing `ControlValueAccessor`. The template checks `inputElement.errors?.['required']` to display a user-friendly message. This validation typically runs before any API call is made.\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`maxlength=\"50\"` → `[maxlength]` attribute and Angular Forms Validation:**\n",
       "     *   JSF's `maxlength` enforces a character limit.\n",
       "     *   Similar to `required`, we bind the `maxlength` attribute to the HTML input. This provides immediate client-side feedback.\n",
       "     *   Angular's forms validation system also recognizes the `maxlength` error (accessible via `inputElement.errors?.['maxlength']`), allowing for consistent error message display.\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **`styleClass=\"input-big\"` → CSS Class Binding:**\n",
       "     *   This is a direct mapping. The `styleClass` attribute in JSF becomes a class binding (`class=\"input-big\"`) or is managed within the component's CSS file.\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **No Direct AJAX/Server Calls:**\n",
       "     *   Unlike components that trigger server actions, `p:inputText` primarily handles data binding and validation.\n",
       "     *   In Angular, this component focuses *only* on the UI element and its local validation. The actual submission of data (like calling a `saveUser` API) would be handled by a parent component or a dedicated form component that uses this `TextInputComponent` as part of its larger form structure. The parent component would gather all input values (potentially using `FormGroup`) and then trigger the service call.\n",
       " \n",
       " ### 4. Integration Notes\n",
       " \n",
       " *   **FormsModule/ReactiveFormsModule:** Ensure that `FormsModule` (for `ngModel`) or `ReactiveFormsModule` (for `FormGroup`, `FormControl`) is imported into your Angular module where this component is declared or used.\n",
       " *   **Angular Material:** Make sure Angular Material is set up in your project and `MatFormFieldModule`, `MatInputModule`, and `MatIconModule` (if using icons in other components) are imported into the appropriate module.\n",
       " *   **Parent Component:** This `TextInputComponent` is designed to be used within a larger form structure in a parent component. The parent would manage the overall form state, validation, and the final submission logic.\"\"\"\n",

It gives us direct access to the native input element and its properties/methods within the template, particularly useful for accessing validation state (`invalid`, `dirty`, `touched`, `errors`).\\n*   **`<mat-error ...>`:** This section displays validation error messages.\\n    *   `*ngIf=\"inputElement.invalid && (inputElement.dirty || inputElement.touched)\"`: The error message is only shown if the input is invalid *and* the user has interacted with it (either typed in it or blurred from it).\\n    *   `*ngIf=\"inputElement.errors?.[\\'required\\']\"`: Checks if the `required` validation error is present.\\n    *   `{{ requiredErrorMsg }}`: Displays a customizable error message for the required field.\\n    *   `*ngIf=\"inputElement.errors?.[\\'maxlength\\']\"`: Checks if the `maxlength` validation error is present.\\n\\n#### `text-input.component.ts` (Logic)\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { Component, Input, Output, EventEmitter, forwardRef } from \\'@angular/core\\';\\nimport { ControlValueAccessor, NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR } from \\'@angular/forms\\';\\n\\n@Component({\\n  selector: \\'app-text-input\\',\\n  templateUrl: \\'./text-input.component.html\\',\\n  styleUrls: [\\'./text-input.component.css\\'],\\n  providers: [\\n    {\\n      provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,\\n      // Use forwardRef to handle circular dependencies\\n      useExisting: forwardRef(() => TextInputComponent),\\n      multi: true,\\n    },\\n  ],\\n})\\nexport class TextInputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {\\n  // Inputs for configuration\\n  @Input() label: string = \\'Input\\';\\n  @Input() placeholder: string = \\'\\';\\n  @Input() maxlength: number = 50; // Default matches JSF\\n  @Input() required: boolean = false; // Default matches JSF\\n  @Input() appearance: \\'fill\\' | \\'outline\\' = \\'outline\\';\\n  @Input() floatLabel: \\'auto\\' | \\'always\\' | \\'never\\' = \\'auto\\';\\n\\n  // Custom error messages as inputs\\n  @Input() requiredErrorMsg: string = \\'This field is required.\\';\\n\\n  // Internal state for ngModel binding\\n  value: string = \\'\\';\\n\\n  // ControlValueAccessor properties\\n  private onChange: (value: string) => void = () => {};\\n  private onTouched: () => void = () => {};\\n\\n  constructor() {}\\n\\n  // Called when the input value changes in the template\\n  onValueChange(newValue: string): void {\\n    this.value = newValue;\\n    this.onChange(newValue); // Notify Angular forms about the change\\n    this.onTouched(); // Mark the control as touched\\n  }\\n\\n  // --- ControlValueAccessor Implementation ---\\n\\n  // Method to register the callback function to be called when the value changes.\\n  registerOnChange(fn: (value: string) => void): void {\\n    this.onChange = fn;\\n  }\\n\\n  // Method to register the callback function to be called when the control is touched.\\n  registerOnTouched(fn: () => void): void {\\n    this.onTouched = fn;\\n  }\\n\\n  // Method called by the forms module to write a value into the component.\\n  // This is how programmatically setting the value works (e.g., userBean.name = \\'new value\\')\\n  writeValue(obj: any): void {\\n    if (obj !== undefined) {\\n      this.value = String(obj);\\n    }\\n  }\\n\\n  // Optional: Method to disable the form control.\\n  setDisabledState?(isDisabled: boolean): void {\\n    // If needed, you can disable the native input element here\\n    // e.g., document.getElementById(\\'yourInputId\\').disabled = isDisabled;\\n    // For this component, we might not need explicit disabling logic passed down,\\n    // as the parent form handles disabling.\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n*   **`implements ControlValueAccessor`:** This interface is crucial for integrating the custom component into Angular\\'s reactive forms (`FormGroup`, `FormControl`) or template-driven forms (`ngModel`). It allows Angular\\'s form system to read and write values to our component and track its state (dirty, touched, valid).\\n*   **`providers: [...]`:** This configures the component to provide itself as an implementation of `NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR`. This is how Angular\\'s forms system discovers and interacts with our custom input component. `forwardRef` is necessary because `TextInputComponent` refers to itself within its own provider definition.\\n*   **`@Input() ...`:** These properties allow the parent component to configure the `TextInputComponent` (label, placeholder, maxlength, required status, etc.). These directly map to the attributes of the original JSF component.\\n*   **`value: string = \\'\\';`:** This internal property holds the current value of the input. It\\'s bound to the `<input>` using `[ngModel]`.\\n*   **`onValueChange(newValue: string): void`:** This method is called by `(ngModelChange)`. It updates the internal `value` and, importantly, calls `this.onChange(newValue)`. `onChange` is a function provided by Angular\\'s forms module (via `ControlValueAccessor`) that signals the change upstream. It also calls `this.onTouched()` to mark the control as touched.\\n*   **`ControlValueAccessor` Methods:**\\n    *   `registerOnChange`: Stores the callback function that Angular uses to update the form control\\'s value when our component\\'s value changes.\\n    *   `registerOnTouched`: Stores the callback function that Angular uses to mark the form control as touched.\\n    *   `writeValue`: This method is called by Angular\\'s forms API to set the component\\'s value programmatically. This is how `userBean.name` being updated would reflect in the input field.\\n    *   `setDisabledState` (Optional): Can be used to handle disabling the input if the parent form control is disabled.\\n\\n#### `text-input.component.css` (Styling Ideas)\\n\\n```css\\n/* Example for the \\'input-big\\' class */\\n/* This might be redundant if using Angular Material\\'s default sizing, */\\n/* but useful for specific overrides. */\\n.input-big {\\n  /* Example: Make the input field wider */\\n  width: 100%; /* Or a specific pixel value like 300px */\\n  /* Adjust margins, padding as needed */\\n  margin-bottom: 16px;\\n}\\n\\n/* If you need to style the native input element directly within the mat-form-field */\\n/* Use ::ng-deep or specific selectors if necessary, but try to avoid it */\\n/* For example, to increase font size: */\\n/* ::ng-deep .mat-form-field-wrapper .mat-form-field-flex .mat-form-field-infix input.mat-input-element {\\n  font-size: 1.2em;\\n} */\\n\\n/* Or better, rely on Angular Material theming and input properties */\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n*   **`.input-big`:** This CSS class directly corresponds to the `styleClass=\"input-big\"` attribute. You would put styles here to control the size, spacing, or any other visual aspects of the input field container. Using `width: 100%` within a flexible layout is common.\\n*   The commented-out `::ng-deep` example shows how you *could* style deeper elements if absolutely necessary, but it\\'s generally discouraged as it breaks encapsulation. Prefer using Angular Material\\'s built-in configuration options or styling the host component (`.input-big`) where possible.\\n\\n### 3. How AJAX Behavior Maps to Angular\\n\\n*   **`value=\"#{userBean.name}\"` → Two-way Binding (`[ngModel]`, `(ngModelChange)`) and `ControlValueAccessor`:**\\n    *   JSF\\'s `value` attribute creates a direct link between the UI element and the managed bean property.\\n    *   Angular uses `[ngModel]` for binding the data property (`value` in `TextInputComponent`) to the input element.\\n    *   `(ngModelChange)` captures user input.\\n    *   The `ControlValueAccessor` implementation (`writeValue`, `registerOnChange`) ensures that this component integrates seamlessly with Angular\\'s form handling, allowing it to receive updates (like `userBean.name = \\'new value\\'`) and emit changes back to a parent form control or service.\\n\\n*   **`required=\"true\"` → `[required]` attribute and Angular Forms Validation:**\\n    *   JSF\\'s `required=\"true\"` triggers server-side validation.\\n    *   In Angular, we use the native HTML `[required]` attribute binding, which provides client-side validation.\\n    *   We also leverage Angular\\'s forms validation system by implementing `ControlValueAccessor`. The template checks `inputElement.errors?.[\\'required\\']` to display a user-friendly message. This validation typically runs before any API call is made.\\n\\n*   **`maxlength=\"50\"` → `[maxlength]` attribute and Angular Forms Validation:**\\n    *   JSF\\'s `maxlength` enforces a character limit.\\n    *   Similar to `required`, we bind the `maxlength` attribute to the HTML input. This provides immediate client-side feedback.\\n    *   Angular\\'s forms validation system also recognizes the `maxlength` error (accessible via `inputElement.errors?.[\\'maxlength\\']`), allowing for consistent error message display.\\n\\n*   **`styleClass=\"input-big\"` → CSS Class Binding:**\\n    *   This is a direct mapping. The `styleClass` attribute in JSF becomes a class binding (`class=\"input-big\"`) or is managed within the component\\'s CSS file.\\n\\n*   **No Direct AJAX/Server Calls:**\\n    *   Unlike components that trigger server actions, `p:inputText` primarily handles data binding and validation.\\n    *   In Angular, this component focuses *only* on the UI element and its local validation. The actual submission of data (like calling a `saveUser` API) would be handled by a parent component or a dedicated form component that uses this `TextInputComponent` as part of its larger form structure. The parent component would gather all input values (potentially using `FormGroup`) and then trigger the service call.\\n\\n### 4. Integration Notes\\n\\n*   **FormsModule/ReactiveFormsModule:** Ensure that `FormsModule` (for `ngModel`) or `ReactiveFormsModule` (for `FormGroup`, `FormControl`) is imported into your Angular module where this component is declared or used.\\n*   **Angular Material:** Make sure Angular Material is set up in your project and `MatFormFieldModule`, `MatInputModule`, and `MatIconModule` (if using icons in other components) are imported into the appropriate module.\\n*   **Parent Component:** This `TextInputComponent` is designed to be used within a larger form structure in a parent component. The parent would manage the overall form state, validation, and the final submission logic.'}, artifact_delta={}, transfer_to_agent=None, escalate=None, requested_auth_configs={}, requested_tool_confirmations={}, compaction=None, end_of_agent=None, agent_state=None, rewind_before_invocation_id=None), long_running_tool_ids=None, branch=None, id='00cf3070-c3a8-4622-99d1-9b6b3a1f09e3', timestamp=1763211869.586083)]"
